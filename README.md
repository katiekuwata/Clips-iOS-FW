Clips-iOS-FW
============

This project is based on the project clipsmm-mobile for MAC OS X. I could not convert the project to a framework project for iOS so I created this project from scratch.

Steps created this project
--------------------------
* Downloaded the file (CLIPS_6.30_Beta_Mac_OS_X_Installer_R1.pkg) from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/clipsrules/files/CLIPS/6.30/ 

* Then unzip "Source Code.zip" file

* I created universal framework similar steps described in 
[Building a Universal Framework for iOS](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2011/12/13/building-a-universal-framework-for-ios/)

TODO
----

* TestFWCalc is a sort of wrapper I am planning to use. Explorer if we can use clipsmm wrapper.
